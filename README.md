### Introduction
These code are implemented for conducting a fundamental performance investigation into GAE runtime environments to make narrow while "apple-to-apple" comparisons based on different language runtime. To support such a project, we empirically investigated the free language runtimes (i.e. Java 7, Java 8, Python, Go, and PHP) of GAE standard environment.

### Contents
Each folder contains a program which can run in GAE standard environment and several contrast trial code.
